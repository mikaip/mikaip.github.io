The biggest hurdle approaching this project was my feeling of preparedness for it, or the lack of it. While I was excited to have landed on the last page of the curriculum, I knew that my understanding of react and redux was inadequate even after reviewing many different resources. After some pondering over whether I should take another tutorial/course to be safe, alas I decided I should just dive into the project and grasp the concepts more fully as I go! It’s supposed to entail everything I learned up to now: I knew I should start super simple and build outward.

I especially had a hard time with understanding this section conceptually. It helped me to get a big-picture understanding by making my own diagrams and drawing out the concepts on paper so that I can visually connect them. But still, unlike the previous projects where I felt relatively prepared with a plan, I thought I would never get started on this one if I kept pushing it off endlessly.

Anyway, the project did seem endless. This was especially because I started with the most basic idea and just expanded from there. Several times I felt exasperated from the most (seemingly) miniscule, syntactical mistake, like when I spent hours of research and altering of code and frustration and confusion and feeling of hopelessness, to find that a pair of parenthesis in my function was breaking my app. These are good to learn from, though, and I guess it is how it goes when one builds out an app! As much as this was a larger-scale project than our previous ones, the feeling of exhilaration whenever I got something to work was rewarding.

The app consists of two models: a trip (city) and an attraction. And the idea is simple: users can add a city they want to visit, then add the places they want to visit in that city, or they can add an attraction first. Setting up the rails api was fairly easy as well as connecting it to the frontend using foreman (with the help of the resource provided). I added components like a navbar and sidebar, and the main trip and attraction containers and forms.

Building out the react and redux elements was confusing as expected, and I wanted to add more challenges so that I can learn as much as I can. The whole idea of connecting to the store and the lifestyle methods became clearer to me as I built it out. I was pretty much improvising a lot of the aspects of the project as I did not have a structural plan to follow. Normally this would not have been a smart idea, however in this case it worked out, because having a limited strategy and confidence level somehow enforced my learning better. Part of it was that I realized I knew more than I thought, and part of it was that I was forced to look up and search out everything, step by step, and put things into practice. Looking at other project examples definitely helped me a lot in terms of how to organize and implement various things.

I know that as of now the app is just a very basic version, at its first review point, and it is something I want to continue expanding on. I’d like to add additional features such as comments/reviews, a search feature, and sorting abilities. I still have a lot to work on, but I'm in disbelief that I have finally reached the end of the curriculum. It has been a very long ride, but I hope it was worth it, and I look forward to furthering my learning and reviewing everything I learned.

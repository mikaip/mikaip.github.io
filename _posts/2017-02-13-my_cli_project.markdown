This is my first post for my blog, which I only just recently learned about when I saw it was a requirement for the project... I’m a-little-very-extremely late but here is my first project! For this CLI gem assignment, I had wanted to use an idea that would be unique and not boring (partly the reason for my delaying it). Ultimately I decided to just go with a simple one because the importance of the project was on learning the process of writing the code and not the idea itself. I had to find a source that was scrapable(?) for me, so after a few attempts with some confusingly-designed sites, I chose one that I was able to scrape.

I really had no idea how to start, but after watching the walkthrough that was provided with the lab as well as the refactoring tutorials, I decided to go for it and started by following along (I relied on these videos throughout). I followed along almost exactly with the walkthrough at first, and then the concert gem video afterwards. As a result, my code is like a combination of the two because they provided a lot of similar ideas to the way I had wanted to present my CLI. These two videos were especially helpful for me and allowed me to grasp a better sense of what was going on, step-by-step.

Some challenges that I ran into:
-	How to iterate through a doc source to display at the start of the CLI, rather than hard-code each individual item.
-	Setting up and connecting related files
-	How to go into deeper levels beyond just scraping from one page
-	I initially ran into some issues of pushing to github, which is still a bit confusing for me at times – need to review and practice
- To review further: github and git; modules

What I learned/reaffirmed:
Write out a plan; start somewhere/anywhere even if unsure; google things; use pry often; look at other examples to see different ways of thinking; write comments, don't overthink, commit often!
